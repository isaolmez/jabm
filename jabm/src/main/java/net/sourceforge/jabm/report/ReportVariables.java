 * <p>
 * This interface allows the same metrics to be collected in different ways, for example at different frequencies: we
 * might collect data on the mean population fitness at the end of each generation, at the end of each simulation, or at
 * some specified temporal frequency.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the computation of population fitness can be coded once in a single implementation of
 * ReportVariables, and then different Reports can be created which update these variables at the required frequency or
 * in response to the required events.
